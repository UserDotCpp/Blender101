#   **INSTALLING RIGIFY**
    

Rigify is already included in Blender and you activate it (almost) as any other addon.

From the main Blender menu click Edit > Preferences

Go to the addons tab. In the search field type Rigify. Put a check-mark next to “Rigging: Rigify”.![activate Rigify. Blender > preferences > addons ](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_a9b242c98c89ff5a.jpg)
