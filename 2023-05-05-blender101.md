# BLENDER101
> A “practical” guide to make low poly models for games in Godot

dragging from the tip opens a new view window

![](0.png)

*   “Numpad 5” for **orthographic** mode
*   any setting can be apply to multiple objects at a time by selecting them with “shift” + “click” and clicking the option while holding “alt” 
*   middle click to lock one of the xyz axes  
*   “t” and “n” to close menus  
*   “cntl” + “d” to make a copy of the object

*   “Numpad 3” is right of the **orthographic** mode and “Numpad 1” is the front
  
![](1.png)

#   **SYSTEM STUFF**
 
“Shift” + “a” place object on the location of the **cursor**

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_2bfcc0a2d54bb959.png)

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_a99afa06c61a2d65.png)

“Z” lets u change the view of the models

\-**wireframe**: is for editing polygons

\-**solid**: for viewing faces

\-**material**: preview is for viewing and placing materials

\-**rendered**: is for testing lighting and or seen the final productThe universal tools are enable in object mode:

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_8302cd35154d18b9.png)


\-G to **move** positions(this is camera dependent)

\-R to **rotate** the model

\-S to **scale** it´s size

\[IF U USE “alt” + any of the above u reset the transformation\]

All of this are locked to your camera view so use the **orthographic** cameras to manually edit or look and axes(x, y, z) and input the value or manually move the line

## Edit mode

Press “tab” to change from object mode to **Edit mode** ![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_9f55ba24a2742e4b.png)

you can press “A” to select all the mode´s **vectors**/**edges**/**faces**

depending of the: ![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_65366b36d99143b4.png)

##   **SELECT MODES**
    

on the top left you can chose what ll be edited

##  **TOOLS**
    

“g”:to move stuff

“E”:to **extrude** a new **region**(vector/edge/face) correlative to the one that's selected

“S”: for changing the **scale** in stuff

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_75e2db3d1e97b4c8.png)


#   **LOW POLY MESH WORKFLOW** 

firs spawn(“shift” + “a”) a cylinder(its in **mesh**, this works best as a base for low poly, remember to change the vertices to 6 or 5) make it fit the sizes of your reference like so: 
![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_7605416ad5a244dd.png)

then you have to go to

0.  - Modifier
        - \-add_Modifier
          - \ **Mirror**

and apply “**Clipping**”


once your model its finish u have to mark it **seems**(the edges of the **mesh texture**):

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_a26b08d924df3518.png)

do the “soda can” method: 

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_fd6b8fbb10a46ba6.png)
 
if u want to make a soda can flat with the least number of cuts u should cut it top and bottom edges and make a middle cut in the body: do this for every limb that u want to apply a specific texture(remember that seems don’t look to good, try to hide where they are so it doesn’t look 2 ugly)

##   **UV MAPPING SETUP**
    
>    in the **layout workspace** (on the middle top of the screen) 
![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_be9978d8d915b8ba.png)


in edit mode select your mesh, go to option and select **live unwrap**


![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_f09f28809c5b402c.png)

  

for the left window you can open the “**UV** **editor**” and selecting “**display stretch**” to make sure that none of your faces ll deform

blue == good / green == bad

![](3.png)

  

#   **ONCE YOU ARE FINISH with ALL THE** **SYMMETRICAL** **EDITS**
    

you can go to the **mirror modifier** and apply it, this makes it a real mesh, do this to export or to create a non symmetrical texture

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_3426d6eb3332c84f.png)

  

#   **BEFORE MAKING THE TEXTURE REFERENCE REMEMBER**
    

1\_ once your seems are marked you can select them apart

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_a5ef995aaeb6ebe2.png)

2\_ try to make textures with this parameters in mind

alt + f rotates the object

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_ba9c6da0a1e340c4.png)

alt + f rotates the object 

for the materials, u can use the closest texture interpolation:

![](blender101_html_585e91cfc35e1bbf.png)

so there are no blurry filters for the textures


##   **TEXTURE PAINTING SETUP**    

in the **layout workspace** (on the middle top of the screen)

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_e5ca5d468d6e9424.png)

once in

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_1c997ea546caf6fb.png)

mode go to the **shading options** (top right) and select flat shading to see the pure colors

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_cd787f3109d54c8d.png)

then, in the **active tool** setting you need to create a new material/texture, a base color in this case(this just modifies the **albedos**)


![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_2bdcd5e4a01049d3.png)

  

still in active tool go to **falloff** and disable it so u can draw near the edges

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_cd3a35094b548a57.png)

  

if u enable **paint mask** u can select faces in edit mode (or use “L” to select the **islands** that u delimited with the seems)and paint them with the bucket tool.
  

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_8573d706322e5c48.png)


#   **RIGGING FOR GAME EXPORTING**
    

your asset needs a **rig**(**armature** or **bones**)to be animated and to store its animations, u ll end up with 3 main objects in the file:

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_2f29513cbbfcc561.png) 

\-**the mesh**: this is the 3d model with its own **materials** and **textures.**

\-**the meta rig**: the game rig is a combination of the rigged “deform bones” for the game engine to have a reference of the bone hierarchy and the “vertex weights” that are the connection of the character mesh and the deform bones (this determines how much the mesh ll stretch when the bones deform and how pronounce the deformation will be).
>can add the -noimp 

-**The game rig** is the one that u export,the meta rig is the base state of the model, it uses the control rig for animations and drivers that are of no use to the game engine, thats why we create a **game rig**, which it is just a meta rig with out the constraints and all the control rigged animations baked in 

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_2f0cb3959c1ba54c.png)

-the control bones or **control rig**: this is what u use to interact with the 2 other objects in the animations, it lacks deforming bones, a bones hierarchy and you can implement any constraints drivers or whatever you want in it coss once the animations are **baked** into the model, u wont have further use for this bones in the game editor, so u shouldn't export this bones.
>can add the -noimp 


##   **FOR THE GAME RIG/META RIG**
    

In edit mode, go to **object data** -> **properties** and display the bones in front

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_10a3893c0b3c7ff2.png)

>its good practice to change the display as types of bones for different rigs		
![](blender101_html_b41ec2b154f1d71d.png)



**THE SPINE MUST BE THE FIRST THAT U DO**
once all your bones are in place start parenting (**keep offset**):
> Coss sometimes the keep offset doesn’t work well and blender sets the first bone as the root bone

Give all symmetrical bones the “.L” suffix it should end up like so:

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_6de8402f630073.png)


> (REMEMBER!!!!!!!!!
The last selected bone ll hallway be the root of the offset, if u select more than the 2 bones (“shift” + “click”) the last one been selected ll be the parent): ![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_3da50fd1b5682abc.png)

  

once u r done select all bones(“A”) in edit mode and **symmetrize**

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_fd574e1472a422c0.png)

and name the **armature** “game\_rig”

to finish it u have to parent the mesh to the **meta\_rig**(game rig if u gonna export it manually)

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_9d9988083a6963a1.png)

  

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_7bb6c3757f814a3d.png)

  

beware the shitty automatic weight painting, u ll have to modify that stuff manually using:

##   **WEIGHT PAINT WORKFLOW**
    

in object mode select the “game\_rig” or “meta\_rig”(mesh + armature)and the “mesh” in the 3d viewer, NOT on scene collection

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_d66724af215171b1.png)

  
  

and go to weight paint mode

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_8e746d35acbbd7b5.png)

 
now the mesh is in weight paint mode and the armature is in pose mode:

  

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_4bf0a37411906f70.png)

  
inside of “tools” u have to enable 2 settings for the weight painting, the auto normalize

  

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_9a3768560912cc20.png)

  

  

##   **FOR THE CONTROL RIG**
    

first, establish the connection of the game rig and the control rig using constrains:


in the game rig go to one bone and add the following constraint

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_3a639eedb56da080.png)

> don't be scared if its looks like so 

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_ee8417ac62de4fd3.png)

  

then select all of the bones(pressing “A”) and load the following code in editor type → **text editor**:

```python

import bpy
#Switch to Pose Mode.

sel = bpy.context.selected\_pose\_bones 

for bone in sel:
  name = bone.name
  bpy.context.object.pose.bones\[name\].constraints\["Copy Transforms"\].subtarget = name

```
  

then apply it(this works coss the bones in the game rig and the control rig are the same)go to

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_ef567706d5ad12a3.png)

  

###   **ROOT CONSTRAINTS SETUP**
    

**REMEMBER: ALL BONES MUST BE CONSTRAINT TO THE ROOT BONE**

**ALSO\[ ALL IKS AND DRIVERS MUST BE NON DEFORMING BONES \]**

  

first set the snapping to increments and turn on the snap during transformation

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_c8605270f55079db.png)

for the root bone

align the axes to the word axes name it “root” then copy the root bone to make the “pelvis control”(remember to toggle the **snapping** during transformation) once bout of the bases are done, set the constraint(**keepoffset :** ”cnt” + “p”)by: first clicking the spine then setting the pelvis control as a parent and the root as a parent of that one

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_2a485220ff6008b9.png)

###   **IKS EXAMPLES** **(inverse constraint)**
    

for the ik of the leg, fist, extrude a bone from the leg by disconnecting it with “alt” + “p” and **clear parent**, in pose mode, name it (“IK.L” in this case) then shift selecting the shin bone u do “cnt” + “shift” + “c” for the constraint menu **choosing inverse kinematics** once the constraint is set, go to the target(in this case the shin bone)and in **chain length** slider specify how many child bones the constraint affects

> (**REMEMBER: ALL BONES MUST BE CONSTRAINT TO THE ROOT BONE**)

  

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_af91c4e3c88ce3e.png)


###   **HARD LIMIT CONSTRAINT MOVEMENT**
    

if u don’t want the constraint moving on specific axes, go to the target, **inverse kinematic** and lock them manually

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_724dfa81fef68df4.png)


###   **SOFT LIMITS OF CONSTRAINT MOVEMENT** (**pole** **target**)

if u want to move the constraint until it hits a certain spot u have to make a second constraint, in the in this case, u want the shin to not deform when going up, so u extrude a bone from the shin and move it up a high where the leg stops twisting, like so:
    

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_2f8cec7d8e54d1bc.png)


name it (in this case “pole.L”) set the target like so:

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_5ba7a58081b0b269.png)

  

  

then in edit mode select the pole, shift select the IK control and keep offset so the top moves with it

###   **MAKE BONES IGNORE** **HIERARCHY** **(copy location constraint)**
    

if u want a bone to not be aftereffect by a parent bone, u have to extrude it from the bone hierarchy and only be move by the IKs

(you would be skimping a bone in the hierarchy). On this example, the foot should stay stationary when the body moves but it does this:

  

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_fbbaa5b6f4124965.png)

  

select the foot press “alt” + “p” in edit mode and clear its parents then select the shin bone(the one in yellow in the picture) and shift select the foot, “cnt” + “shift” + “c” for the **copy location** transform, the foot is going to go for the shin location, to make it respect the bones like before go to bone constraints properties, **head/tail** value to 1

  

 ![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_21a59fd2385014d9.png) ![](4.png)


>**REMEMBER: once done select the “.L” bones go to edit mode → armature and then select symmetrize**

###   **IK FINAL TOUCHES**
    

in **pose mode** go to **bone properties**, first go to **deform**, select all none deforming bones(just the IKs and motors) hover the mouse over the checkbox and while holding “alt” u ll disable all the selected bones deformation.

For giving bones a custom look, u ll have to create a shape or curve in the object mode(i recommend creating a different folder for the bone references and the hidden it so they don’t boater)once it is done go to **pose mode** → **bone properties** inside **view port display**, there is **custom object** and select your bone reference

  
# **FIX ERRORS/ ADD BONES TO THE ALREADY FINISHED METARIG/GAME RIG**

there are 2 ways to go about it, coping the new armatures or making sure that the new armatures that u want are in the same place in bout rigs, for this example i'm adding a new bone so the face can be stretched(if u forgot: extrude “e” a new bone and split “y” it, select the splitted bone then shift select the face bone and “cnt” + “p”)

![](blender101_html_d41991e0c0724295.png)
 
then “shift” + “d” to make a copy of the new bone and separate it with “p” select the new armature then “shift” select the control rig and press “ctrl” + “j” to merge them

make sure it haves the same name in bout armatures “chin in this example” select the new bone(the meta rig one) in pose mode shift select its parent bone(first the new bone then the parent) then go to pose properties

![](blender101_html_9e52bddbe21877d3.png)

properties -> constraints -> copy Constraints to Selected Bones

once that's done in bone constraint properties change the target bone to the new one 

![](blender101_html_1edb8f2731bb8d7a.png)

because u created new bones u need to reparent the mesh to the meta rig,in object mode click the mesh(in the 3d viewport) then shift click the meta rig , “cnt” + “p” and u'll have to choose either set parent to: with empty groups if u already had weight painted the bones  or automatic weights if u didnt 

#   **ANIMATING ON BLENDER WORKFLOW**
    

go to pose mode, in the edit type on animations select Dope Sheet, once there the default editing context been displayed is Dope Sheet, change it to action editor

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_ae245c44245b7178.png)

  

then create a new action and set its fake user so u don’t lose your animations in the NLA editor or something else goes wrong

 ![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_d300a05b7aafbdd1.png) ![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_c5398c5f7e78f48a.png)

with “a” select all of the bones and with “I” u ll open the insert Key Frame menu, chose Location and Rotation(..& Scale if u ll change it)so u ll have your first frame, if u want to make a key frame toggle auto keying set when it happens and it ll record it

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_965f2a489e5123b6.png)


to make a mirror copy of an action copy all the changes down in the action editor move the cursor where u want the mirror to be then press “ctrl” + “shift” + “v”, “shift” + “d” to duplicate it normally and “shift” + “e” to set the key frame extrapolation method

 
#   **EXPORTING TO GODOT**
    

the manual way of exporting a model with animation is:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW8w6X1fLg8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW8w6X1fLg8)

this doesn’t work good enough so people made an addon to improve the workflow:

[https://toshicg.gumroad.com/l/game\_rig\_tools](https://toshicg.gumroad.com/l/game_rig_tools)

##   **ORGANIZING THE ANIMATIONS FOR EXPORTING**
    

if u want to export the control rig animations u ll have to organize them in the NLA(**nonlinear animations**) by:

selecting an animation in the dope sheet editor type making sure it plays correctly, then changing the editor type to **nonlinear animation** and organizing them one by one like so: ![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_3e36522a4e293a64.png)

## **EXPORTING GODOT GAME RIG GENERATED BY THE GRT ADDON**
    
first select the control rig or meta rig if u have one(if u had a control rig/meta rig select that one or don’t, check the end result coss sometimes it doesn’t work right :/ )
> (The meta rig only haves the rig and the mesh, the control rig haves the animations(the instructions on how to move the meta rigs/game rig) bones, using this addon u ll take the meta rig and bake the animations of the control rig.
U r doing this to avoid exporting stuff that Godot cant use like drivers and non deforming bones)

**MAKE SURE THAT THE BONES ARE MARKED AS “DEFORMING BONES” AND THE IKS AND CONSTRAINTS ARE NOT** then go to the game rig tools in the pose mode and select generate game rig (there a lot of setting for the moment leave them alone), sometimes the addon cant get your rigs hierarchic right when game rig so u ll have to make sure its set right by:


![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_5b874cb92492ef8a.png)


the new game rig cant move on its own coss its constraint to the meta rig, so u ll have to mute the constraints using the addon and check one by one if the hierarchy is the same (u can also check in the **outliner editor** type but this way gives better visual feed back)once u are done checking, revert any changes to the rig(“alt” + “g” “r” or “s” )now go to the game rig tools menu →GRT: **Action Bakery** and load them all select the control rig and game rig location and bake them animations (they should be the ones without prefix if u done it right)

![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_3031f9b19e58efad.png)


then export it as **gltf 2.0** (if u have blender 3.0 or older add the tag “-noimp” at the end of all extra stuff)in include, mark **selected objects**, in transforms **+y up,** in geometry **apply modifiers** and THE MOST IMPORTANT in Animation **keep group by NLA track** and **Export deforming bones only**

  
![](blender%20tutorialto%20export_html_adc2aa5c9f3168d3.png)


# **GODOT SPECIFIC STUFF**

## **EXPORTING MAPS WHIT COLLISION**

“shift” + “d” all the objects that u want to make a collision mesh out of(or move an object shape as the collision that u want for the level) and then add the suffix -colonly then select the parent object 
>it doesn't have to be the same name, just add the suffix at the end

shift select the collision that u want, press “cntl” + “p” then select object (make sure that its inside of it)u can hide it if u want. Once that's done export the model as Collada(default)(.dea)

### **STUFF FOR AUTOMATIC COLLISION**

Once u make the copy of the object u can apply the mesh modifier for simpler collisions (play around with octree depth for different results)

![](blender101_html_c698b2c487d6a022.png)

### **BLENDER TO GODOT SUFFIXES**

```
Remove nodes (-noimp) 
Create collisions (-col, -convcol, -colonly, -convcolonly)
Create navigation (-navmesh) 
Create a VehicleBody (-vehicle) 
Create a VehicleWheel (-wheel) 
Rigid Body (-rigid) Animation loop (-loop, -cycle)
```
## **CREATE A SEPARATED FACE TEXTURE AND PREPARE IT FOR ANIMATING IT**

This needs to be more streamline but for the time being, this is the best way to animate a face with a shader. First create a new **material** inside **material properties** and assign the face to it

![](blender101_html_b35c92fd2ca15c78.png)

then open the **Texture workspace** and create a new **base color** inside the new material(it u had a size for the face in mind multiply it by the amount of faces that u want or if u had a size restriction for every texture divide it)

![](blender101_html_5c9377384b9350db.png)

once u create the texture open the **UV Editing workspace**, in the UV menu, select **Export UV Layout**

![](blender101_html_3dfdc78835260b36.png)

### **EDITING THE FACE TEXTURE OUTSIDE OF BLENDER**

Open your editor of choice (Aseprite in this example), trim the texture so it's centered. U can create the amount of different faces that u want to make using your editor of choice

![](blender101_html_aff7eeee53be9d59.png)

Once u r done, export it in rows(so u can try to use a ratio like the original texture so the uvs don't stretch too much)inside of Blender open the **Texture workspace**, in the **Image** menu(next to the UV one from before)select **Replace…**. Open the new exported texture, resize the uvs to fit(if one of them fits the rest of them ll fit later)
>u can hide the other UVs with "h" and reveal hidden UVs with "alt" + "h"

and u r done

![](blender101_html_29cf4e26146edf7c.png)
